## Usage
You have access to the following sub generators:
* **yo ng2-webpack:service** (Creates a service)
* **yo ng2-webpack:pipe** (Creates a pipe)
* **yo ng2-webpack:component** (Creates a component)
* **yo ng2-webpack:directive** (Creates a directive)
* **yo ng2-webpack:interface** (Creates an interface)

You may prefer to use npm to run your sub-generators.
For a complete list of available commands and to add tab auto-completion, run the following commands in a terminal:

    $ npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    $ npm run <tab><tab>
    
which will produce the following output    
```

build             docs              new-directive     server            webdriver-start
ci                e2e               new-interface     start             webdriver-update
clean             e2e-live          new-pipe          test              
clean-install     lint              new-service       test-watch        
clean-start       new-component     postinstall       watch      
 
```

This workflow serves as a starting point for building component based Angular 2.0 applications using Webpack. 

* Heavily commented webpack configuration with reasonable defaults.
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Development server with live reload.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* Testing environment using karma to run tests and jasmine as the framework.
* Code coverage when tests are run.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

### Quick start


```bash

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# start the server
$ npm start
```

go to [http://localhost:2368](http://localhost:2368) in your browser.

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:2368`.

## Developing

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm run watch`

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`
